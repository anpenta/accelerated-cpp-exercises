# Accelerated CPP Exercises

This repository contains solutions to selected exercises from the book: "Accelerated C++: Practical Programming by Example, 1st edition". The naming convention for the cpp files is: ```[chapter]-[exercise].cpp```.

## Downloading and running the programs

An example of how to download and run the files is provided below.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anpenta/accelerated-cpp-exercises.git
cd accelerated-cpp-exercises/code
make all
```

This will compile all the files into separate executables using the ```Makefile```. You can then run the executables with the command: ```./[chapter]-[exercise]```. You can remove all the executables with the command: ```make clean```.
